SPEC-PLACEHOLDER-001 — Lint placeholder HTML comment blocks in spec files.

The cross-link checker (``check-spec-cross-links.py``) ignores links inside
``<spec-placeholder>...</spec-placeholder>`` blocks (and, for backward
compatibility, the older ``<!-- TODO|FIXME ... -->`` HTML-comment form)
so authors can stash pending references without breaking CI. The
trade-off is that *malformed* placeholder blocks (missing markers,
broken bullet rows, stray text) silently slip through — the very rot
the placeholder was supposed to prevent.

This script validates every placeholder block of either supported
format, per the conventions in ``spec/_template.md``
§"Placeholder cross-references":

    <spec-placeholder reason="activate when target is created">
    - [Target Title](../NN-module-name/00-overview.md)
    - [Target Title](../NN-module-name/01-file-name.md#section-anchor)
    </spec-placeholder>

    <!-- legacy form, still supported -->
    <!-- TODO: activate when target is created
    - [Target Title](../NN-module-name/00-overview.md)
    - [Target Title](../NN-module-name/01-file-name.md#section-anchor)
    -->

Rules enforced (lightweight, no AST):

  P-001  Placeholder *intent text* must be a complete imperative
         sentence so reviewers see actionable language. Specifically:

           * Wording follows the marker (``TODO:`` / ``FIXME:`` for
             legacy comments, ``reason="…"`` for ``<spec-placeholder>``).
           * It must be non-empty and start with a recognized
             imperative verb (``activate``, ``add``, ``link``,
             ``replace``, ``wire``, ``update``, ``write``, ``create``,
             ``document``, ``cross-reference``). Extend the allowlist
             via ``--allow-verb <verb>`` (repeatable).
           * It must end with a period — half-sentences like
             ``activate later`` are rejected; ``Activate when target is
             created.`` passes.

         The verb is matched case-insensitively. Articles/auxiliaries
         like ``please`` are stripped before the check so
         ``please add the link.`` passes.
  P-002  Every non-blank body line must be a markdown bullet
         (``- [text](link)``) — no stray prose, no orphan list markers.
  P-003  Bullet links must be relative paths ending in ``.md``
         (optionally with ``#anchor``); ``http(s)://`` and bare anchors
         are rejected because placeholders are meant for *future*
         internal targets, not external references.
  P-004  Block must contain at least one bullet (empty placeholders are
         dead code).
  P-005  Block must not contain blank lines (keeps the snippet
         contiguous per template guidance).
  P-006  Every opening marker must have a matching closer
         (``-->`` or ``</spec-placeholder>``).
  P-007  Two or more placeholder bullets must not point at the same
         target ``.md`` file (anchor ignored — duplicates pointing at
         different sections of the same file still collapse to one
         pending activation). Detected within a file and across files.

Only multi-line comment blocks that start with the ``TODO:``/``FIXME:``
marker on the opening line are linted. Single-line comments and
non-placeholder comments (e.g. license headers) are left alone. The
``<spec-placeholder>`` form is *always* linted because the tag itself
declares intent.

Exit codes:
  0  = no malformed placeholder blocks
  1  = one or more violations found
  2  = invocation error

    ``--with-similarity`` was passed — the four similarity columns
    just stay empty when no ``_RenameSimilarity`` is attached.

    When ``with_labels=True`` (driven by ``--similarity-labels``) a
    seventh ``score_kind`` column is APPENDED — never inserted — so
    positional readers that already hard-code indices 0–5 keep
    working unchanged and only need to opt into index 6 when they

    ``rename-similarity`` / ``copy-similarity`` / ``unscored`` (R or
    C rows) and empty for plain A/M/D rows, mirroring the JSON
    ``score_kind`` field exactly.

    Empty `score` cells are *intentional* and meaningful: they mark
    *unscored* rename/copy rows (authored ``--changed-files`` payloads
    that omitted the percentage) and distinguish them from
    ``score=0`` (git observed the pair and rated them entirely
    dissimilar). Keep that distinction when filtering in Excel —
    ``ISBLANK`` vs ``=0`` are not the same condition.

    Quoting is delegated to the stdlib ``csv`` writer with the default

    escaped per RFC 4180 and round-trip through every mainstream CSV
    reader. ``newline=""`` on the file handle is mandatory per the
    ``csv`` module docs to avoid stray blank lines on Windows.

    ``dialect`` selects the field separator and quoting rules:

    * ``"csv"`` (default) — stdlib default dialect: comma separator,
      double-quote quoting, RFC 4180 escapes. Byte-for-byte
      unchanged from the legacy behavior when the caller doesn't
      pass the kwarg.
    * ``"tsv"`` — stdlib ``csv.excel_tab`` dialect: tab separator,
      same double-quote quoting rules. Use when commas inside
      paths/reasons would force quoted cells, or when piping into
      ``cut -f`` / ``awk -F'\\t'`` style tools. Tabs and newlines
      inside cell values still get quoted via the underlying
      ``csv`` writer, so the round-trip is lossless.

    Header row, column order, and the empty-vs-``0`` score
    convention are identical across both dialects — only the
    separator changes.

    """Print the diff-mode changed-file audit table to ``stream``.

    Always writes to STDERR (the caller passes ``sys.stderr``) so
    STDOUT remains a clean single-document JSON payload (or the
    usual human summary) regardless of this flag.

    Two output modes:

    * ``as_json=False`` — aligned text table with a header row, a
      counts-by-status footer, and stable input ordering. Empty
      input prints a single ``(no changed files considered)`` line
      so the operator never wonders whether the flag silently
      no-op'd.
    * ``as_json=True``  — JSON array of ``{"path", "status",
      "reason"}`` objects, one per row, in stable input order.
      ``ensure_ascii=False`` so non-ASCII paths round-trip readably.

    When ``dedupe=True`` the rows are passed through
    :func:`_dedupe_audit_rows` first: each repo-relative ``path``
    appears at most once, with the FIRST seen ``status`` + ``reason``
    preserved verbatim. The text-mode header is annotated with the
    drop count so the collapse is auditable; JSON consumers can
    diff the array length against the upstream intake size.

    When ``only_statuses`` is a non-None frozenset, only rows whose
    ``status`` is in that set are printed (or serialized). Filtering
    runs AFTER dedupe so first-seen semantics are evaluated against
    the full intake — a ``matched`` row that lost the dedupe race to
    an earlier ``ignored-extension`` for the same path stays hidden,
    same as without the filter. The text-mode header reports both
    the visible row count and the underlying total so a filter that
    hides everything is obvious (``0 of 12 row(s) shown``); the
    totals line still counts every status in the canonical order so
    the operator can see exactly what was filtered out.

    When ``with_similarity`` is True the rendered table grows three
    extra columns — ``kind``, ``score``, ``old`` — populated from each
    row's ``similarity`` field. ``None`` similarities (plain A/M rows
    + every ``ignored-deleted`` row, which carries no rename
    provenance) render as ``-`` in all three columns. R/C rows whose
    score is ``None`` (scoreless authored payloads) render the score
    cell as ``-`` while still showing the kind and old-path. JSON
    mode emits a nested ``similarity`` object (or ``null``) using
    :func:`dataclasses.asdict` so the schema is regular for downstream
    consumers. Off by default to keep the legacy 3-column shape and
    avoid widening logs that don't care about provenance.

    When ``with_labels`` is True (driven by ``--similarity-labels`` and
    only meaningful in combination with ``with_similarity``) one more
    column — ``meaning`` — is appended to the text table, carrying the
    canonical ``rename-similarity`` / ``copy-similarity`` / ``unscored``
    discriminator (or ``-`` for plain A/M/D rows). In JSON mode the
    same value is added to the nested ``similarity`` object as a
    ``score_kind`` field; for plain rows where ``similarity`` itself
    is ``null`` the discriminator is naturally absent. The legacy
    schema is preserved byte-for-byte when the flag is off.

    When ``verbose`` is True (driven by ``--list-changed-files-verbose``)
    the audit exposes the per-row intake provenance for every
    ``ignored-deleted`` row:

    * **Text mode** appends a trailing ``source`` column whose
      cell is the raw provenance tag (``diff-D`` /
      ``changed-files-D``) on ``ignored-deleted`` rows and the
      blank-cell sentinel (``-``) on every other row.
    * **JSON mode** adds a top-level ``"source"`` key to EVERY
      row in the array — ``str`` on ``ignored-deleted`` rows and
      ``null`` everywhere else — so the schema stays regular and
      downstream JSON consumers can ``.get("source")`` without
      branching on status.

    Off by default (``verbose=False``) the ``source`` field is
    stripped entirely from the JSON payload (legacy 3-key schema
    preserved byte-for-byte) and the text table renders without
    the trailing column.

    Two input modes:
      * ``diff_base`` → invoke
        ``git diff --name-status -M -C --diff-filter=AMRCD
        <base>...HEAD`` from ``repo_root``. The triple-dot syntax
        compares HEAD against the merge-base with ``<base>``, which
        matches GitHub's PR diff and survives force-pushes / rebases
        on the base branch. The ``AMRCD`` filter keeps Added,
        Modified, Renamed, Copied, *and* Deleted paths. Deletes are
        never linted (a deleted file can't carry a new violation in
        the post-state) but they ARE recorded in the audit trail
        with status ``ignored-deleted`` so downstream consumers can
        see the full intake. For ``R``/``C`` rows we take the *new* path so
        the linter re-checks the file under its post-rename location
        — that's where the placeholder block lives now, and a rename
        commit often touches it (e.g. updated back-pointer hints).
        ``-M`` enables rename detection (default 50 % similarity)
        and ``-C`` enables copy detection so the new sibling of a
        copy is also linted.
      * ``changed_files`` → read newline-delimited paths from the
        given file (``-`` = stdin). Blank lines and ``#`` comments are
        ignored. Useful for CI runners that compute the diff
        themselves (e.g. ``dorny/paths-filter``) or for local testing
        without a git invocation. Renames may be expressed on a
        single line as either ``OLD\\tNEW`` (tab-separated, matches
        ``git diff --name-status`` output verbatim) or
        ``OLD => NEW`` (matches ``git status -s`` rename arrows). In
        both forms the OLD path is discarded and the NEW path is
        linted as a normal change. A ``D\\tpath`` row in this input
        is recorded as ``ignored-deleted`` in the audit trail.

    ``audit`` (optional out-parameter): when provided, every path the
    intake considered is appended as a :class:`_ChangedFileAudit` row
    classified by extension/root/existence/delete-status. Pass
    ``None`` (the default) to skip the bookkeeping entirely — the
    legacy hot path stays allocation-free.

    Returned paths are absolute + resolved and filtered to:
      * extension ``.md``
      * residing under ``root`` (so a README change doesn't trigger a
        spec scan)
      * actually present on disk (a Modified path that was reverted

    Unknown / malformed rows are skipped silently — the linter's job
    is to lint placeholders, not to police git plumbing output.

    When ``deleted`` is provided, every ``D``-status row contributes
    a ``(path, source)`` tuple — in input order, after
    :func:`_unquote_git_path`. The ``source`` is always ``"diff-D"``
    for this parser (rows come straight from
    ``git diff --name-status``); the audit-trail emitter uses the
    tag to look up the per-provenance ``reason`` string in
    :data:`_DELETED_REASON` so each ``ignored-deleted`` row explains
    *why* it was classified that way.

    When ``similarities`` is provided, every ``R``/``C`` row contributes
    one ``new_path → _RenameSimilarity`` entry. The mapping key is the
    *unquoted* new path (so it matches what ``raw`` carries downstream)
    and the value records ``kind`` (``R``/``C``), ``score`` (0–100, or
    ``None`` when git emitted no digits — pathological but cheap to
    tolerate), and the unquoted ``old_path``. Plain A/M/D/T rows are
    not recorded — the renderer treats their absence as "no similarity
    metadata" and prints the dash sentinel.

    Hardened against git's path-quoting and whitespace edge cases:

    * Tabs are the field separator. C-quoted paths
      (``"with\\ttab.md"``) are decoded *before* the tab split would
      see them, so an embedded literal tab inside a filename can't
      masquerade as a column separator.
    * Trailing CR on the row (CRLF input from a Windows-piped diff)
      is stripped per-field by :func:`_unquote_git_path`.
    * The R/C arm requires a non-empty *new* path (``cols[2]``) but
      tolerates an empty *old* path slot — git never emits one, but
      hand-rolled diff payloads occasionally do, and there's no
      reason to discard the row when its NEW side is well-formed.
    * Whitespace-only paths (``"   "``) are kept as-is — POSIX
      permits them, and ``Path.is_file()`` downstream will resolve
      whether the file actually exists.

    """Collapse rename-bearing rows in a ``--changed-files`` payload
    down to their post-rename path.

    When ``deleted`` is provided and a row is recognizable as a
    delete (``D\\tpath`` — the exact shape ``git diff --name-status``
    emits), the path is captured into ``deleted`` as a
    ``(path, "changed-files-D")`` tuple and the row is NOT forwarded
    to the caller. The provenance tag distinguishes it from true
    diff ``D`` rows so the audit emitter can surface a different
    ``reason`` string per source. Without ``deleted`` (the default),
    such a row falls through to the generic tab-form branch and the
    bare path travels downstream to be filtered by extension/root
    checks — same end result as before this audit-trail addition.

    Plain paths (no tab, no ``=>``) pass through unchanged. Comments
    and blanks are *not* stripped here — the caller does that on the
    normalized output so we don't lose alignment with the source line
    numbers in error messages.

    Hardened against the same whitespace + quoting edge cases as
    :func:`_parse_name_status`:

    * Tab rows: instead of dropping every empty column (which
      silently re-indexes ``R\\t\\told\\tnew`` to ``[R, old, new]``
      and then ``cols[-1]`` is correct, but ``R<score>\\told\\t\\t``
      would re-index to ``[R<score>, old]`` and steal ``old`` as the
      "new" path), we keep the column count intact and pick the
      last non-empty field. Quoted fields are unquoted; trailing
      CR is stripped.
    * Arrow rows: the regex no longer requires ``\\S`` at the path
      boundaries, so a path with a leading/trailing space round-
      trips correctly. The ``new`` group is unquoted to match what
      a user pasted from ``git status``.
    * A line that contains *only* whitespace (or a CR-only line on
      Windows input) is passed through verbatim so the caller's
      blank/comment filter can still discard it on the same line
      number.

    When ``similarities`` is provided, R/C-shaped tab rows AND arrow
    rows contribute one ``new_path → _RenameSimilarity`` entry. Tab
    rows whose first column matches ``R<digits>?`` / ``C<digits>?``
    record both the kind letter and (when present) the numeric score;
    a kind letter without digits records ``score=None``. Arrow rows
    (``OLD => NEW``) are recorded as ``kind="R", score=None`` because
    git status doesn't emit a similarity percentage in short form —
    we know it's a rename, but not how close. Plain paths (no
    rename signal at all) are not recorded.

# to "no diff context available" if the line isn't part of the
