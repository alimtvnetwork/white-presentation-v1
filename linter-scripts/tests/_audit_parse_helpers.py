"""Shared parsing helpers for the changed-file audit surfaces.

The placeholder-comments linter renders the same in-memory audit
through three surfaces:

* ``text``  — a banner, a header row, a separator, the data
  rows, and a trailing ``totals: …`` summary line on STDERR.
* ``--json`` — a JSON array on STDERR (currently the *only*
  thing on STDERR, but future work may add a banner or summary
  before/after the array, and the parser must not break then).
* ``--similarity-csv`` — a CSV file on disk; today it's just the
  header + rows, but a trailing ``# totals: …`` comment line
  could be appended as a summary footer in the future.

Several test modules previously rolled their own ad-hoc parsers
(``json.loads(stderr.strip())``, raw ``csv.DictReader`` over the
whole file, ``re.match`` line-by-line over STDERR). Those were
brittle:

* ``json.loads(stderr.strip())`` blows up the moment a banner or
  totals line is appended around the JSON array.
* ``csv.DictReader`` happily yields a row for any trailing
  comment / totals line because it doesn't know what an
  "audit row" looks like.
* the per-line text regex is well-anchored on the closed status
  vocabulary, but several call sites duplicated the regex with
  small drifts.

These helpers centralize the parsing and, critically, **stop at
the first non-audit line** — so any banner, blank line, or
trailing ``totals: …`` summary is treated as an end-of-audit
marker rather than data.

The companion test
``test_audit_parse_helpers_trailing_summary.py`` pins the
contract: each helper must drop trailing summary lines and
return only the real audit rows.
