"""Pins the ready-to-copy JSON example payload at
``linter-scripts/examples/rename-intake-audit.json``.

The example is referenced from ``README-rename-intake.md`` as the
canonical demonstration of every ``status`` × ``similarity``-shape
combination the rename/copy intake can emit. If a future schema
change drops a status, renames a key, or alters the scored /
unscored / null trichotomy, this test fails so the docs and the
shipped artifact stay in lock-step with the renderer.

Coverage we lock in:

* every value of the closed ``status`` vocabulary appears at least
  once;
* ``similarity`` only ever takes one of three shapes —
  ``{kind, score: int, old_path}`` (scored),
  ``{kind, score: null, old_path}`` (unscored), or ``null`` (no
  rename/copy provenance);
* every non-``ignored-deleted`` status is exercised in *both* the
  scored-object and the ``null`` shape so consumers can copy a
  representative row for any case;
* ``ignored-deleted`` rows always carry ``similarity: null`` (the
  pre-state has nothing to score against).
