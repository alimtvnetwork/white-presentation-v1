"""Unit tests for ``_parse_unified_diff_post`` in
``linter-scripts/check-placeholder-comments.py``.

Covers the three edge classes called out by the spec:

* **Blank lines** — empty rows inside a hunk are valid context
  (a context line whose payload happens to be empty); the parser
  must still advance the post-state line counter so subsequent
  lines stay correctly numbered.
* **Missing hunks** — completely empty diff, file-headers only,
  malformed ``@@`` header, and lines outside any hunk must all
  produce an empty ``_DiffExcerpts`` rather than crashing or
  generating bogus line numbers.
* **Removed-line gaps** — ``-`` rows must NOT advance the post-
  state line counter (they have no post-state coordinate); the
  next ``+`` / `` `` row keeps the counter the parser was on.

Each test is a pure-function check on synthetic diff text — no
git invocation, no temp files. Tests assert the post-state
``lines`` map plus ``min_line`` / ``max_line`` because those three
together are the public contract consumed by ``render()``.
