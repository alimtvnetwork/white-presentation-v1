"""Exhaustive cross-surface check that every ``ignored-deleted``
row's ``reason`` exactly matches one of the allowed resolved
values from the shared vocabulary (``_DELETED_REASON``).

Sibling tests already cover specific provenance tags
(``test_ignored_deleted_reason.py``,
``test_ignored_deleted_audit_coverage.py``). This module is the
contract guard: regardless of *how* a deleted row reaches the
audit (in-process via :func:`_resolve_changed_md`, parser-direct
via :func:`_parse_name_status`, or out via the
CLI's text / JSON / CSV renderings), its ``reason`` must be a
member of the canonical set ``set(_DELETED_REASON.values())``.

The fallback string (``_DELETED_REASON_FALLBACK``) is *intentionally
excluded* from the allow-list: it exists for forward-compat with
future provenance tags the parsers may add before the vocabulary
catches up. A production row landing on the fallback today means
the parser emitted a tag the vocabulary doesn't know about — that
is the bug these tests are designed to catch.

Identity guard
--------------
The dataclass-level test compares with ``is`` (object identity),
not just ``==``. The current implementation looks reasons up via
``_DELETED_REASON.get(src, fallback)`` so the vocabulary string
object is reused verbatim. A future refactor that returns a
freshly-formatted string (``template.format(...)``) would still
compare equal but break identity — which would also break the
"closed vocabulary" contract this test is pinning. Equality is
used for the rendered surfaces (text / JSON / CSV) because those
round-trip through serialization and lose Python identity by
construction.
