"""Per-source ``reason`` strings for ``ignored-deleted`` audit rows.

Each provenance tag emitted by the parsers must map to a distinct,
human-readable ``reason`` so an operator scanning the audit table
can see *why* a path was classified as deleted (true diff `D` row
vs. authored `--changed-files` `D\tpath` payload).

Covers the end-to-end pipeline by feeding hand-built parser output
through ``_resolve_changed_md`` (no real git, no temp repo) and
inspecting the resulting ``_ChangedFileAudit`` rows.
