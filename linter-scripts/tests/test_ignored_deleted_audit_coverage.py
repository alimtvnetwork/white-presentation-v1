"""Comprehensive coverage for `--list-changed-files` deleted-path
behavior and the `ignored-deleted` audit row.

These tests fill gaps left by the existing suites
(``test_list_changed_files_flag.py``,
``test_ignored_deleted_reason.py``,
``test_only_changed_status_flag.py``,
``test_dedupe_changed_files_flag.py``) — specifically:

* deletes-only intake exits with a clean PASS (no scan to run, no
  violations to find);
* the totals footer counts deleted rows under the
  ``ignored-deleted`` bucket — distinct from the matched/ignored-
  missing buckets;
* the JSON array includes deleted rows in input order alongside
  matched ones, with the per-source ``reason`` text on each;
* the dedupe pass keeps the FIRST occurrence when a path appears as
  both ``ignored-deleted`` and (later) some other status;
* the audit goes to STDERR even when only deleted rows exist
  (regression guard against an early-return path silently dropping
  them);
* the parser's per-source provenance tag is observable on every
  ``D``-row regardless of leading whitespace / trailing newline
  variations a CI runner might introduce.

The CLI tests invoke the linter as a subprocess so STDOUT/STDERR
separation is exercised through real OS pipes — the same way a CI
job would consume the output.
